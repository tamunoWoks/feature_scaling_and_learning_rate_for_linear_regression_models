# Feature scaling and Learning Rate (Multi-variable Linear Regression)
### Goals
In this notebook you will:
- Utilize the multiple variables routines developed in our previous projects
- Run Gradient Descent on a data set with multiple features
- Explore the impact of the learning rate alpha on gradient descent
- Improve performance of gradient descent by feature scaling using z-score normalization
### Tools
We will utilize the functions developed in the last notebook as well as `matplotlib` and `NumPy`.
